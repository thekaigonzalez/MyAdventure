You keep wandering around, beginning to develop hypothermia.

You hear sirens in the distance and start running.

The police arrive, they take you in for questions and you
give them all the information, the scheme was reported on and
the people behind it were sent to jail.

Turns out it was a bunch of military workers that would sedate innocent people
and take them into the underground. It made people think it was
real and some even died.

You have been traumatized ever since.
